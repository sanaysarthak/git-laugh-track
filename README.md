<!--OVERVIEW --> 
<a id="overview"></a>
## Overview :-

Git Laugh Track is a fun and lightweight tool that adds a sitcom laugh track to your Git workflow. Every time you make a commit, a random laugh track sound will play, bringing a bit of humor and joy to your development process.

Key features include:
- Plays a random sitcom laugh track on every Git commit.
- Easy to install and uninstall.
- Works with most popular audio players (`paplay`, `mpg123`, `afplay`).
- No dependencies beyond standard Unix tools and an audio player.
- Easily customizable: Add your own MP3 files to personalize the laugh track experience.
